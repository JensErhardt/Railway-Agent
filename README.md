<h1> Ironhack Project #3 - Railway Agent </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
Railway agent is my final project during  the fullstack web dev bootcamp, and is an instant information app as a single page application using the MERN stack, that shows consolidated live data from Deutsche Bahn using three different APIs of <a href="http://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset?groups=datasets"> DB open adata network..

<h2> Features </h2>
- Live data for available Flinkster & CallABack rental objects (cars / bikes) within a radius of 500 meters around the trainstation
- Occupancy prognoses for attached carparks of DB BahnPark 
- Customizable dashbord (toggling between map or list)
- The user can pin trainstations to his favorite list

<h2> Technologies Used </h2>

Railway Agent is a single page application using  React, Express, MongoDB, Passport, HTML 5 and CSS 3 and Bootstrap.
